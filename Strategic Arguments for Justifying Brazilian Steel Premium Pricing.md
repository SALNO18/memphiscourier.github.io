## 1. Critical Market Intelligence: MSF's Recent Assessment of Asian Suppliers

### 1.1 Direct Market Research in China and Turkey

MSF HOLDING LTDA has recently conducted comprehensive on-site assessments of steel suppliers in China and Turkey, providing invaluable first-hand intelligence about the current state of these markets. This direct market research has revealed significant concerns that validate the strategic importance of choosing Brazilian steel for Israeli construction projects.

The MSF team's visits to major steel production facilities in both countries have uncovered systemic issues that go beyond simple price comparisons, revealing fundamental problems with reliability, quality consistency, and supply chain stability that pose unacceptable risks for critical infrastructure projects.

### 1.2 Turkish Suppliers: Unwillingness to Supply Israeli Market

A critical finding from MSF's Turkey assessment is the widespread reluctance of Turkish steel suppliers to engage with Israeli buyers. This reluctance stems from various geopolitical considerations and regional tensions that make Turkish suppliers unreliable partners for Israeli construction projects.

Turkish steel producers, despite having competitive pricing and reasonable quality standards, have demonstrated clear hesitation to commit to long-term supply agreements with Israeli companies. This reluctance creates significant supply chain risks, as Turkish suppliers may withdraw from agreements or impose unfavorable terms due to political pressures or regional developments.

The geopolitical instability affecting Turkish-Israeli commercial relationships makes Turkish steel an unreliable option for projects requiring guaranteed supply continuity. MSF's direct conversations with Turkish producers confirmed that many are actively avoiding Israeli contracts, preferring to focus on other regional markets where political considerations do not complicate commercial relationships.

### 1.3 Chinese Steel: Fundamental Quality and Reliability Concerns

MSF's comprehensive assessment of Chinese steel facilities has revealed systemic quality control issues that pose significant risks for construction projects requiring consistent material properties. The team's technical evaluation identified multiple areas of concern that validate long-standing industry concerns about Chinese steel reliability.

**Quality Control Deficiencies:** Direct observation of Chinese production facilities revealed inconsistent quality control processes, with significant variations in testing procedures and quality assurance protocols between different suppliers and even within the same facility across different production runs.

**Supply Chain Instability:** Chinese suppliers demonstrated concerning levels of supply chain instability, with frequent changes in raw material sources, production schedules, and delivery commitments. This instability makes it extremely difficult to guarantee consistent supply for projects with fixed timelines.

**Technical Specification Compliance:** MSF's technical team identified significant concerns about Chinese suppliers' ability to consistently meet Israeli technical specifications, particularly regarding seismic resistance requirements and material consistency standards that are critical for Israeli construction projects.

## 2. Technical Superiority and World-Class Certifications

### 2.1 International Sustainability and Quality Certifications

Brazilian steel, particularly from ArcelorMittal Brasil, possesses certifications that establish a globally recognized standard of excellence. The company was the first in the Americas to obtain ResponsibleSteel Core Site certification, a milestone that demonstrates commitment to the highest standards of quality and sustainability.

ResponsibleSteel certification represents the world's first standard specifically instituted to highlight leading ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices in the steel sector. This recognition is not merely symbolic - it attests that industrial plants meet 13 rigorously evaluated principles covering environmental, social, and governance aspects in steel production and consumption.

The certification process is extremely rigorous, lasting approximately 18 months and involving more than 120 hours of training and 150 hours dedicated to action monitoring. The certifying company, DNV Brasil, is an internationally recognized organization that evaluates criteria such as responsible business conduct, occupational health and safety, stakeholder needs assessment, environmental impact control, water resource management, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity protection.

With nine certified units in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, and Santa Catarina, ArcelorMittal Brasil has established that 42% of Brazil's steel production will be sustainable when all units are certified. This level of certification is unmatched in the Asian market, where pressure for low costs frequently compromises investments in sustainability and quality.

### 2.2 Compliance with Rigorous Technical Standards

Brazilian steel is produced following rigorous technical standards that guarantee consistency and superior quality. ABNT (Brazilian Association of Technical Standards) standards establish internationally recognized requirements that frequently exceed minimum specifications for many applications.

ABNT NBR 7480, for example, is an essential reference standard that ensures steel follows rigid and reliable standards. This standard establishes specific requirements for steel rebars intended for reinforced concrete structures, including chemical composition, mechanical properties, dimensions, and tolerances.

Additionally, the SAE/AISI/ABNT classification system uses logic that allows precise identification of whether the steel is low, medium, or high carbon, providing transparency and predictability for end users. This systematic classification contrasts significantly with the variability found in Asian products, where standard application can be inconsistent.

### 2.3 Superior Quality Control

Quality control in Brazilian steel production is fundamentally superior to that found in many Asian countries. While Chinese steel frequently presents problems with poor inclusion control and inadequate heat treatment, Brazilian steel maintains consistent standards through more controlled production processes.

Steel inclusions can cause serious problems during machining and compromise material structural integrity. Brazilian steel, produced with advanced technology and rigorous controls, minimizes these problems through more efficient refining processes and stricter quality control.

Heat treatment, another critical aspect of steel quality, is performed more consistently in Brazil, resulting in more predictable and reliable mechanical properties. This consistency is essential for structural applications where variability can compromise construction safety.

## 3. Logistical Advantages and Geopolitical Stability

### 3.1 Safe and Reliable Maritime Route

The maritime route from Port of Santos to Ashdod offers significant logistical advantages that justify a premium price, especially in the current context of instability in Asian routes. While traditional routes from Asia to Israel face growing security and reliability challenges, the Brazilian route remains stable and predictable.

Since late 2023, with events resulting from the Israel-Hamas war, there have been direct impacts on international maritime freight, especially on Asian routes. The Red Sea, one of the most strategic routes for international trade, has become an area of growing instability due to Houthi attacks. Major container shipping companies, including MSC, Maersk, CMA-CGM, and Hapag-Lloyd, have opted to avoid the Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas.

This situation has forced carriers to circumnavigate the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, resulting in up to 53% increase in distance traveled. Minimum average transit time has increased by almost 40% from Asia to the Mediterranean and 15% to Northern Europe. These detours not only prolong and increase voyage costs but also introduce significant uncertainties in delivery schedules.

In contrast, the route from Brazil to Israel remains direct and safe, without passing through conflict zones or areas of geopolitical instability. This stability provides schedule predictability that is essential for construction projects depending on timely material deliveries.

### 3.2 Brazil's Geopolitical Stability

Brazil offers geopolitical stability that contrasts significantly with growing risks associated with Asian suppliers. While China faces increasing commercial tensions with multiple countries and Taiwan Strait conflict risks, Brazil maintains stable and predictable commercial relationships with its international partners.

The US-China trade war has created significant uncertainties for Chinese suppliers, with successive tariffs and export controls that can affect product availability and pricing. China has responded by blocking exports of critical minerals as retaliation, demonstrating how geopolitical considerations can disrupt supply chains.

Brazil, on the other hand, is not involved in significant commercial conflicts and maintains a pragmatic foreign policy that prioritizes stable commercial relationships. This stability translates to greater predictability for international buyers, reducing risks of sudden supply interruptions due to geopolitical factors.

### 3.3 Schedule Reliability

Schedule reliability is a critical factor justifying Brazilian steel's premium price. While Asian routes face increasing delays due to security-forced detours, climate-related bottlenecks in Chinese ports, and political instabilities, the Brazilian route offers greater predictability.

Hidden costs of construction project delays frequently exceed initial savings obtained with lower prices. Delays can result in additional labor costs, idle equipment, contractual penalties, and impacts on other project schedules. Superior reliability of the Brazilian supply chain can therefore result in significant net savings for the final buyer.

Additionally, the ability to maintain predictable schedules allows better project planning and reduces the need for safety stocks, freeing working capital for other productive applications.

## 4. Significant Risks of Asian Suppliers

### 4.1 Structural Quality Problems

Asian suppliers, particularly Chinese ones, face structural quality problems that represent significant risks for buyers who value consistency and reliability. Detailed technical analyses reveal that Chinese steel frequently presents poor inclusion control and inadequate heat treatment, problems that can seriously compromise construction structural integrity.

Inclusions in Chinese steel can cause serious problems during machining and significantly reduce structure lifespan. Experienced engineers report cases where Chinese steel pieces that had been machined for years began presenting quality problems, forcing supplier changes and resulting in significant additional costs.

Batch-to-batch variability is another critical problem with Asian steel. While one batch may meet specifications, the next may present significantly different mechanical properties, creating design uncertainties and potential safety problems. This inconsistency contrasts with Brazilian steel's superior uniformity, where more rigorous quality control processes guarantee greater batch consistency.

### 4.2 Chinese Steel Industry Instability

The Chinese steel industry faces structural problems affecting its reliability as a long-term supplier. The sector has been facing overcapacity for years, which has pressured margins and worsened companies' debt situations. This financial pressure frequently results in cost cuts that compromise product quality.

China's real estate crisis since the pandemic has significantly reduced domestic steel demand, forcing producers to seek external markets through dumping practices. This situation creates unsustainable dependence on subsidized exports that can be interrupted at any time by government policy changes.

The Chinese government has already demonstrated willingness to interrupt production when necessary, as evidenced by the immediate suspension of the approval system for new steel plants in 2024. This direct government intervention creates uncertainties for international buyers depending on consistent supply.

### 4.3 Compliance and Certification Risks

Asian suppliers frequently present significant challenges in terms of compliance and certification. Many documents issued by Chinese manufacturers are in Mandarin, which can generate translation and interpretation errors, especially regarding critical technical specifications.

The need for extensive audits and complex due diligence to verify Asian supplier reliability adds significant costs and time to the acquisition process. Documented cases of outright fraud, including products that do not meet declared specifications, create additional risks that must be mitigated through costly verifications.

Inconsistent application of technical standards is another significant problem. While Asian suppliers may claim compliance with international standards, practical implementation frequently varies, resulting in products that technically meet minimum requirements but do not offer expected quality and reliability.

### 4.4 Trade War and Geopolitical Tension Impacts

The US-China trade war has created an uncertainty environment that directly affects Chinese supplier reliability. Successive tariffs and export controls can rapidly alter supply economic viability, forcing sudden supplier changes and disrupting established supply chains.

Taiwan Strait tensions represent a growing geopolitical risk that can dramatically affect Chinese exports. Any conflict escalation in the region could completely interrupt supply routes, leaving buyers without viable short-term alternatives.

China has demonstrated willingness to use export controls as a geopolitical tool, blocking exports of critical minerals in response to commercial tensions. This commercialization of trade creates additional risks for buyers depending on Chinese suppliers for essential materials.

## 5. Compliance with Israeli Standards and Requirements

### 5.1 Alignment with Standards Institution of Israel (SII)

Brazilian steel is well-positioned to meet rigorous standards established by the Standards Institution of Israel (SII), the sole official body that develops standards in Israel. Compliance with Israeli requirements is facilitated by Brazil's tradition of adhering to rigorous international standards and experience in exporting to demanding markets.

Israel's Standards Mark program operates according to EN 45011 standard, an internationally recognized European standard. To qualify for the Standards Mark, a product must not only conform to applicable standard requirements but also be manufactured in a plant with an approved quality assurance system, similar to ISO 9002. This requirement favors Brazilian producers who already operate with internationally certified quality systems.

The Israeli certification process includes regular product inspections and quality assurance system reviews, performed by laboratory personnel and certified auditors. Product samples are collected several times per year to ensure continuous compliance with relevant standards. This rigorous continuous monitoring approach aligns perfectly with quality practices already established in the Brazilian steel industry.

### 5.2 Mutual Recognition Agreement Advantages

Israel maintains Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) with various international organizations, including UL (Underwriters Laboratories), ETL, IAPMO, and NSF. These agreements significantly facilitate the certification process for products that already possess certifications recognized by these organizations.

Brazilian steel, frequently certified by internationally recognized organizations, can benefit from these agreements to accelerate the Israeli market entry process. UL, for example, maintains mutual recognition with Israel in fields including electricity, electronics, hydraulics, mechanics, and fire protection - areas relevant for structural steel applications.

This certification advantage contrasts with difficulties frequently faced by Asian suppliers, who may have certifications from less internationally recognized organizations or that do not have mutual recognition agreements with Israel.

### 5.3 Benefits of 2024 Import Reform

The import reform implemented by Israel in 2024 significantly simplified the import process, eliminating the need to submit applications to the Standards Institute or recognized laboratories. Under the new system, importers can submit declarations directly to customs, followed by a risk assessment procedure.

This simplification particularly benefits reliable suppliers like Brazilians, who possess an established track record of quality and compliance. The risk assessment system tends to favor suppliers with solid reputations and adequate documentation, characteristics that define the Brazilian steel industry.

The reduction in costs associated with laboratory testing and approval time makes Brazilian steel even more competitive, as compliance costs are reduced without compromising product quality or safety.

### 5.4 Seismic and Safety Requirements

Israel has specific requirements for seismic resistance, codified in standard SI 413, which has been mandatory since 1980. This standard establishes specific seismic coefficients for different structure types, including ductile steel structures that require high-quality and consistent materials.

Brazilian steel, produced with rigorous quality controls and consistent mechanical properties, is well-positioned to meet these demanding requirements. Superior ductility and consistent strength of Brazilian steel provide additional safety margins in critical seismic applications.

In contrast, quality variability frequently found in Asian steels can compromise the ability to consistently meet rigorous seismic requirements, creating unacceptable safety risks in a seismically active region like Israel.

## 6. Cost-Benefit Analysis and Total Ownership Value

### 6.1 Hidden Costs of Low-Price Suppliers

While the initial price of Asian steel may seem attractive, a complete total cost of ownership analysis reveals that Brazilian steel offers superior value. Hidden costs associated with low-price suppliers frequently exceed initial savings, resulting in higher total project costs.

Due diligence and quality verification costs for Asian suppliers can be substantial. The need for factory audits, certification verification, additional quality testing, and continuous monitoring adds significant costs that are not apparent in the material's initial price.

Delivery delays, common with Asian suppliers due to geopolitical instabilities and logistical problems, result in project costs that can easily exceed initial price savings. Each day of delay in a construction project can cost thousands of dollars in idle labor, stopped equipment, and contractual penalties.

Quality variability can result in material rejections, need for retesting, and in extreme cases, replacement of already installed material. These rework and replacement costs can be devastating for project budgets and schedules.

### 6.2 Value of Predictability and Reliability

The predictability offered by Brazilian steel has tangible economic value that justifies the premium price. The ability to rely on delivery schedules, consistent quality, and met specifications allows more efficient planning and reduces the need for costly contingencies.

Supply reliability reduces the need for safety stocks, freeing working capital for other productive applications. For a 3,000-ton project, safety stock reduction can free hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital.

Quality consistency allows structural design optimization, potentially reducing the total amount of material needed. When engineers can trust specified mechanical properties, they can design more efficient structures without excessive safety margins.

### 6.3 Impact on Reputation and Commercial Relationships

Choosing reliable suppliers like Brazilians contributes to ALAT International Trade Ltd.'s reputation for quality and reliability in the Israeli market. This reputation has long-term commercial value that can result in additional business opportunities and stronger commercial relationships.

Quality problems or delays associated with low-cost suppliers can damage customer relationships and compromise future opportunities. The opportunity cost lost due to supply problems can be much higher than initial savings obtained with lower prices.

Association with certified and sustainable suppliers like Brazilians also aligns with growing trends in corporate responsibility and sustainability, factors increasingly important for institutional and government clients.

### 6.4 Risk-Return Analysis

An adequate risk-return analysis must consider not only initial price but also the probability and potential impact of supply problems. Brazilian steel offers a significantly lower risk profile, with lower probability of quality problems, delays, or supply interruptions.

The expected value of Brazilian steel, considering both costs and risks, can be superior to Asian alternatives even with higher initial price. Risk reduction justifies the premium price, especially for critical projects where failures can have serious consequences.

Supply diversification through inclusion of Brazilian sources also reduces geographic concentration risk, providing greater supply chain resilience in the face of regional instabilities.
